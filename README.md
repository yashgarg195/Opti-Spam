Genetic Algorithm (GA) Feature Selection using Longformer embeddings.

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates how to use a Genetic Algorithm to optimize feature masks for text embeddings generated by the Longformer model.  
It integrates feature selection with deep transformer-based embeddings for efficient classification tasks.

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Run all cells sequentially to train and evaluate the GA-based feature selection pipeline.

## Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- transformers
- torch
- deap
- tqdm
